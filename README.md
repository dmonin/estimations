## How it works
You can enter something like this:
- My first prototype 4h #development
- Another thing 2h #design

And it will give you a nice overview of the time and cost.

You welcome. Enjoy! Star repo to say thanks :)


## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
